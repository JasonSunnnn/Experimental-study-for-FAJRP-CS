# Experimental study for FAJRP-CS

This project includes the benchmarks and experiment results of the flexible assembly job-shop rescheduling problem with component sharing.


The benchmarks are used to evaluate the proposed method in our published paper: 'Multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based flexible assembly job-shop rescheduling with component sharing for order insertion'; Everyone is welcome to use our results as comparing baseline and cite our paper:
